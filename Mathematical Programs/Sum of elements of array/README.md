# Number Summation Program

This C program reads `n` numbers from the user and calculates their sum.  
It uses an array to store the numbers before summing them.

---

## How It Works
1. The user specifies how many numbers (`n`) they want to add.
2. The program takes `n` inputs from the user.
3. It calculates the total sum and displays it.

---

## Example
**Input**
```
Enter how many numbers you want to add => 5
Enter 5 numbers:
10 20 30 40 50
```
**Output**
```
The sum is 150

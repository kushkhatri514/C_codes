# Diamond Star Pattern in C

This C program prints a **symmetric diamond-shaped pattern** made of asterisks (`*`). The user specifies the number of lines, and the program displays a centered pattern that expands to a peak and then contracts symmetrically.

---

## Logic Summary

- The number of lines (`n`) must be **odd** for symmetry.
- The pattern consists of:
  - Increasing stars till the middle
  - Then decreasing stars after the middle
- Spaces are added before each row to center-align the stars.

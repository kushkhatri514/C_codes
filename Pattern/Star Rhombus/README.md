# Rhombus Pattern Program in C
---

## Description
This C program prints a rhombus pattern made of asterisks (`*`) based on the number of lines provided by the user.

---

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter the number of lines for the rhombus.
2. It uses nested loops:
   - The first inner loop prints spaces before the stars to shift them to the right.
   - The second inner loop prints the stars.
3. This process repeats for the number of lines entered by the user.

## Example Output

### Input:
enter the number of lines the rhombus must have => 5


### Output:
```
    * * * * * 
  * * * * * 
* * * * * 
```
